This solution does the following:
- For task 1, simply start out by filtering the alphabetic chars and then picking the first and last numeric chars.
- For task 2, map an enumeration on the chars (i, chr) in the following way: 
  For an iterator on the keys ("one", "two", etc.) find a key such that the key fits between current index and end of the line (to avoid index out of bounds).
  If this key is also equal to the string slice input[i..i+key.len()], then there must be a spelled out number there. Replace the first letter of the number
  with the number of interest. (This is okay because we are going left -> right, so sevenine -> 7even9ine and they don't intervene with each other.)
  From here use the method from task 1 to filter out chars, and then create a number from the first and last digit. Then sum them up.
