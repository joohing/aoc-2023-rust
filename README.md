# aoc-2023-rust
My advent of code solutions for 2023, written in Rust (the best language of all time).

This year I decided to write my solutions in Rust. I chose Rust because it is less pliable than e.g. Python, which is the language I did last year's solutions in. This means you have to be more intentional & abstract in your thinking, and you should ideally have a solution mapped out in your head before you attempt to implement it. This seems like it would make your pre-coding planning better, which I think is extremely important to have in order to create good code.
